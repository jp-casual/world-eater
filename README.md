# world-eater
A personal project to gain familiarity with GitHub, practice development in VS Code, and explore the capabilities of GitHub Copilot.

I've settled on a procedurally generated, infinite world, top-down, 2D, browser-based game using Phaser. I've never worked with browser-based development or even heard of Phaser, but I'm interested in development and performance trade-offs in the environment.

What the Game Currently is:
The player is a yellow square able to navigate an infinite world of empty and pellet-populated tiles using arrow keys. There is currently no interaction with the world or pellets beyond navigation.

Where my development efforts are currently focused:
Explore developing an .exe file to be able to launch and play the game easily.
Implement pellet collision detection and collection mechanics.
Tweak pellet spawn for desired frequency and additional objects.
Begin implementing images for background tiles and objects.
