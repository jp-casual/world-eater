# world-eater

I've barely started but you can still [ðŸŽ® Play it now!](https://jp-casual.github.io/world-eater/) it is just a square running around an infinite void with arrow keys.

This is a personal project to gain familiarity with GitHub, practice development in VS Code, and explore the capabilities of GitHub Copilot.

I've settled on a procedurally generated, infinite world, top-down, 2D, browser-based game using Phaser. I've never worked with Javascript or browser-based development or even heard of Phaser, but I've done some analytics engineering with Python and Microsoft technologies.

What the Game Currently is:
The player is a yellow square able to navigate an infinite world of empty and pellet-populated tiles using arrow keys. There is currently no interaction with the world or pellets beyond navigation.
